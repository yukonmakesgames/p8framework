Yukon's custom framework for creating games in MonoGame... or FNA, haven't decided...

HEAVILY WORK-IN-PROGRESS!!!

I am currently learning MonoGame, so things in here might suck. Feel free to make an issue to tell me if my code is bad! (Please be constructive I'm sensitive...)

I am aiming to have a solid framework that I can rely on for things like saving & loading, scene management, garbage collection, and more!
